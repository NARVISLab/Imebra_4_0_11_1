/// \brief This class represents an input stream.
///
/// Specialized classes derived from this class can
///  read from files stored on the computer's disks, on the
///  network or in memory.
///
/// The application can read or write into the stream
///  by using the streamReader or the streamWriter.
///
/// While this class can be used across several threads,
///  the streamReader and the streamWriter can be used in
///  one thread only. This is not a big deal, since one
///  stream can be connected to several streamReaders and
///  streamWriters.
///
/// The library supplies two specialized streams derived
///  from this class:
/// - imebra::stream (used to read or write into physical
///    files)
/// - imebra::memoryStream (used to read or write into
///    imebra::memory objects)
